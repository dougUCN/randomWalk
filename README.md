1D random walk
======================

This simulation is a quick calculation used to determine the impact on stored UCN counts caused by a thin aluminum window in the region of the polarizing magnet for the Los Alamos neutron electric dipole moment.

A description of the methodology used is found in the "Monte Carlo simulations of UCN transport and spin transport" chapter in this [thesis](https://github.com/dougUCN/thesis)
